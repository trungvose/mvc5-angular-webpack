# mvc5-angular-webpack
Integrate Angular and Webpack into ASP.NET MVC application for both development and production deployment.

Recommend to use Visual Studio Code for Angular development and Visual Studio 2017 to run the MVC application.

The repository came up after I answered a question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47918737/3375906)

## How to run?
Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

[Get them now](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) if they're not already installed on your machine.

Verify that you are running node **v6.x.x** or higher and npm **3.x.x** or higher by running the commands **node -v** and **npm -v** in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors.

* Clone or download the repository. It will contain **Server** and **Client** folders.
* Make sure you have node installed as above requirement.
* Open Client folder, run build.bat.
* Open Web-Core.sln in Visual Studio, press `F5` or `Ctrl + F5` to run the web application.

If everything works fine, you will see the screenshot below.
